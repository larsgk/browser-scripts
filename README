1. Follow instructions here to get Scratchbox for Harmattan installed:

http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/Harmattan:Platform_Guide/Getting_started_with_Harmattan_Platform_SDK/Installing_Harmattan_Platform_SDK

Quick steps:

$ wget http://harmattan-dev.nokia.com/unstable/beta2/harmattan-sdk-setup.py
$ chmod +x harmattan-sdk-setup.py
$ sudo ./harmattan-sdk-setup.py admininstall

Post install:  logout/login to get user access to /scratchbox/login

verify by writing '/scratchbox/login'  (CTRL+D to exit)

Sync resolv.conf and host.conf for network access in scratchbox:
 
$ sudo /scratchbox/sbin/sbox_sync

2. Do the following to prepare your environment

$ mkdir /scratchbox/users/$USER/home/$USER/swork
$ ln -s /scratchbox/users/$USER/home/$USER/swork ~/swork

NB: You don't need the explixit swork directory as long as the script directory resides on the same level as the source directories.

You should now have a working dir (~/swork), residing in/accessible from Scratchbox, linked in the root of your user root.

(outside Scratchbox)
$ cd ~/swork
$ git clone git@github.com:larsgk/browser-scripts.git
$ browser-scripts/builddeps-install.sh
$ browser-scripts/clone-sources.sh
$ browser-scripts/build-sources.sh

This should install the necessary deps and fetch the sources needed.

In order to get git installed inside Scratchbox please follow these steps:

sudo echo "deb http://scratchbox.org/debian harmattan main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sb.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install scratchbox-devkit-git

Add this to your PATH inside Scratchbox:
/scratchbox/devkits/git/bin
